// Details of the rendered crowd scenes //
//--------------------------------------//

--> test_1.scene : simple group (3 people), walking side by side. Default parameters.. We can make out the horizontal line shape.
--> test_2.scene : big group (13 people), walking side by side. Default parameters.





--> test_b1.scene : comparison of the influence of the beta1 parameters (i.e associated to the visibility component of
the force related to group). For the blue group, this component is equal to 0.0 (no "communication rules"), for the
other group in red, it is set to zero... We can notice that the blue group reaches the target first but with no real
"plausible" group walking pattern. This illustrate the trade-off between walking fast and have social interactions.

--> test_obstacle_{3,4,5} : examples of bottlenecks. Some failures here.
